# Magic Eight Ball

This is a Magic Eight Ball program, written in Python and licensed under the GPLv3. See LICENSE.txt for more information. 

A user is given a prompt to ask a question of the Magic Eight Ball, and then to press a key to shake the ball and receive an answer. Just as with its real-life counterpart, there are 20 possible answers, some negative, some positive, some neutral. This program will appear to contemplate the answer for a moment, then choose one of the answers from the list at random and return that answer to the user.
