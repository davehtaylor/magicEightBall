# Magic Eight Ball

This is a Magic Eight Ball program, written in Python. A user is given a prompt to ask a question of the Magic Eight Ball, and then to press a key to shake the ball and receive an answer. Just as with its real-life counterpart, there are 20 possible answers, some negative, some positive, some neutral. This program will choose one of the answers from the list at random and return that answer to the user.
